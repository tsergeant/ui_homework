# UI/UX Foundations — Exam Study Guide & Glossary

This document summarizes core concepts from **Week 1: UI/UX Foundations & Project Kickoff**.  
Use it as a **rapid-review reference** when studying for quizzes or exams.

## Core Disciplines

### User Experience (UX)
The **overall experience** a person has when interacting with a product over time.

Includes:
- Motivation to use the product
- Interaction itself
- Feelings after use

Key questions:
- Is it useful?
- Is it usable?
- Is it desirable?

Common UX failure:
- Solves the *wrong problem*, even if the interface looks good.

---

### User Interface (UI)
The **visual and interactive layer** of a system.

Focuses on:
- Layout
- Controls (buttons, forms, menus)
- Visual hierarchy
- Responsiveness and feedback

Key question:
- How do I interact with this?

---

### Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)
An **academic discipline** that studies how humans interact with computing systems.

Relationship:
- HCI → theory and research
- UX/UI → applied industry practices based on HCI

---

## Diagnostic Lens for Failure

When something feels “bad,” identify the source:

- **UX failure**: Did this solve the right problem?
- **UI failure**: Was the interaction confusing or inefficient?
- **Engineering failure**: Was the system slow, unreliable, or inconsistent?

Not all bad experiences are design problems.

## Core Interaction Concepts

### Affordances
Properties of an object that suggest how it can be used.

Examples:
- Chair → sitting
- Button → clicking
- Slider → dragging

Affordances exist whether or not they are visible.

---

### Signifiers
Signals that **communicate affordances** to the user.

Examples:
- Blue underlined text → clickable link
- Raised button styling → pressable element

Affordances define *what is possible*; signifiers show *where to act*.

---

### Feedback
The system’s response to a user action.

Types:
- Visual (button states, loading spinners)
- Auditory (click sounds)
- Haptic (vibration)

Rule:
- Never leave the user guessing whether an action occurred.

---

### Mental Models
The internal explanation a user forms about how a system works.

Problems occur when:
- The user’s mental model ≠ the system’s actual behavior

Example mismatch:
- User thinks “Save” means permanent
- System only saved locally or temporarily

---

## Platform Constraints (Mobile vs. Web)

### Key Principle
Every platform advantage is also a constraint.

---

### Thumb Zone
- **Mobile**: Primary interaction via thumbs; bottom and center are easiest to reach.
- **Web**: Mouse/trackpad allows precise interaction anywhere on screen.

---

### Information Density
- **Mobile**:
  - One clear task per screen
  - Vertical scrolling
- **Web**:
  - Multi-column layouts
  - Dashboards and comparisons

---

### Interaction Modes
- **Mobile**:
  - Gestures (swipe, pinch, long-press)
  - No hover state
  - Gestures can be powerful but undiscoverable
- **Web**:
  - Click, hover, drag
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Hover enables discovery (menus, tooltips)

---

## UX Design Process Models

### Design Thinking (5-Step Model)
A human-centered problem-solving approach.

Typical stages:
1. Empathize
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test

Important note:
- These stages are **iterative**, not strictly linear.

---

### Double Diamond Model
A framework describing alternating phases of divergence and convergence.

Structure:
- Discover → Define (first diamond)
- Develop → Deliver (second diamond)

Key insight:
- Effective design alternates between expanding possibilities and narrowing decisions.

---

### Critical Clarification
Design models are **maps, not schedules**.
- Teams may revisit earlier phases
- Code and data constraints often force design changes
