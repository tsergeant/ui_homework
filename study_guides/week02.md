# Week 2 Study Guide: User Research & Personas (UI/UX)

## Core Idea
User research in UX serves the same role as requirements gathering in software engineering:  
**reduce uncertainty before committing to design and code**.  
Instead of assuming “I am the user,” UX research grounds decisions in evidence about *real people, goals, and contexts*.

## Glossary of Key Terms

**User Research**  
The process of studying users to understand their needs, goals, behaviors, and constraints before designing solutions.

**Human Requirements**  
Non-technical requirements derived from user needs, contexts, and motivations (the UX equivalent of functional requirements).

**Quantitative Research**  
Numerical, large-scale data that explains *what* is happening (e.g., analytics, surveys, A/B tests).

**Qualitative Research**  
Observational or interview-based data that explains *why* something is happening.

**Double Diamond**  
A design model with two phases:
- **Discover (divergent):** gather broad insights
- **Define (convergent):** narrow to a specific problem to solve

**Contextual Inquiry**  
Observing users in their real environment to understand how context (time, place, interruptions) affects behavior.

**Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD)**  
A problem-framing approach that focuses on what users are trying to accomplish:
> “When I’m ___, I want to ___, so I can ___.”

**Persona**  
A fictional but evidence-based representation of a key user type, including goals, behaviors, and frustrations.

**Elastic User**  
An imaginary “everyone” user that stretches to justify any design decision; leads to unfocused design.

**Primary Persona**  
The main user type a system is optimized for when tradeoffs must be made.

**Assumption**  
An unverified belief about users or behavior.

**Hypothesis**  
A testable statement predicting an outcome if a design choice is made.

**Research Ethics**  
Guidelines ensuring user research respects consent, privacy, and avoids manipulation.

**Low-Fidelity Sketching**  
Rough, fast drawings used to explore ideas cheaply before committing to visual design or code.

## Summary Points (Exam-Oriented)

- UX research is **requirements gathering for humans**, not guesswork.
- Quantitative data shows *what* users do; qualitative data explains *why*.
- The Double Diamond separates **problem discovery** from **solution design**.
- Context matters: users behave differently depending on environment and constraints.
- Personas are **design constraints**, not demographic profiles.
- Designing for “everyone” results in designing for no one.
- JTBD reframes features as tools users “hire” to make progress.
- Research reduces risk by turning assumptions into hypotheses.
- Ethical research respects users as people, not data points.
- Sketching is a thinking tool, not an art exercise.

## One-Sentence Takeaway
Good UX design makes intentional tradeoffs based on evidence about real users—before code is written.
